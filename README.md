# Twitter Spaces (2022)

Everything Open Source is an initiative to help more people learn about open source and encourage them to start or keep contributing.
I'll share valuable resources for studying, practicing and contributing to projects.

Here's one of my favourite open source quote:

> In open source, we feel strongly that, to really do something well, you have to get a lot of people involved.
~Linus Torvalds
